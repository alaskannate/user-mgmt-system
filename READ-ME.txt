Here's a coding challenge for you in Node.js:

Challenge: User Management System

Create a simple user management system using Node.js. The system should have the following functionality:

1. User Registration: Users can register by providing a unique username and password. Store the user details in a JSON file or a database of your choice.

2. User Login: Users can log in using their username and password. Implement a login mechanism that verifies the provided credentials against the stored user data.

3. User Authentication: Implement a middleware function that checks if a user is authenticated before allowing access to protected routes. The middleware should verify the presence of a valid authentication token in the request header or cookies.

4. Protected Routes: Create a few protected routes that can only be accessed by authenticated users. For example, an endpoint that returns the user's profile information.

You can use any libraries or frameworks of your choice to accomplish this task. Feel free to structure the code in a way that makes sense to you.

Good luck! Let me know if you need any further clarification.
